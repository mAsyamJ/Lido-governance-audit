/// @notice Provides mechanisms to validate time-based constraints against the current
///     network time (`block.timestamp`). Can be used within a transaction to ensure
///     that time conditions are met.
/// @dev Supports the following types of time validations:
///     - Time windows within a day, including both standard (e.g., 09:00 – 17:00) and
///           overnight ranges (e.g., 20:00 – 06:00).
///     - A deadline: checks that the current time is before a specified timestamp.
///     - A start time: checks that the current time is after a specified timestamp.
