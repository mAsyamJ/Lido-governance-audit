Alright ‚Äî let‚Äôs break it down so you can clearly see why your earlier **PoC exploit worked** and why **mainnet Lido** stops it.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Vulnerable PoC Version (Your Local Exploit)**

You built this:

```solidity
function transferExecutorOwnership(address executor, address newOwner) external override {
    // üö® NO ACCESS CONTROL
    Executor(payable(executor)).transferOwnership(newOwner);
}
```

**Why it worked:**

* **No `onlyOwner` / no role check** ‚Äî any caller (including the attacker) can call it.
* Executor ownership changes instantly to attacker:

  ```
  Executor.owner = attacker
  ```
* Now the attacker **is the owner** and can call:

  ```solidity
  executor.execute(attackerContract, address(executor).balance, "");
  ```
* Funds drain successfully.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Real Mainnet Lido Contract**

The real Lido **EmergencyProtectedTimelock** has:

```solidity
modifier onlyAdminExecutor() {
    if (msg.sender != adminExecutor) {
        revert CallerIsNotAdminExecutor(msg.sender);
    }
    _;
}
```

And then:

```solidity
function transferExecutorOwnership(address executor, address newOwner)
    external
    onlyAdminExecutor  // ‚úÖ Access control here
{
    Executor(executor).transferOwnership(newOwner);
}
```

**Why your mainnet fork test fails:**

* When you try:

  ```solidity
  timelock.transferExecutorOwnership(EXECUTOR_ADDR, attacker);
  ```

  ‚Üí Your attacker address ‚â† `adminExecutor`.
* The check triggers:

  ```
  revert CallerIsNotAdminExecutor(attacker)
  ```
* Function execution stops.
* Ownership **never changes**, so:

  * You‚Äôre not the owner.
  * You can‚Äôt call `executor.execute(...)`.
  * Funds remain safe.

| Access control           | ‚ùå None                  | ‚úÖ `onlyAdminExecutor` |
| Attacker takeover works? | ‚úÖ Yes                   | ‚ùå No                  |
| Can drain funds?         | ‚úÖ Yes                   | ‚ùå No                  |
| Exploit outcome          | Funds stolen            | Exploit blocked       |

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Why Lido still gave you this in the competition**

* They often give **a simplified vulnerable version** in audit competitions **so you can find and explain the bug**.
* In **real mainnet**, they‚Äôve already patched it.
* The **goal** is to see if you can **recognize the missing access control**, prove the exploit in a local fork with a vulnerable version, and explain the impact.

If you want, I can help you **rewrite your Immunefi submission** so it clearly explains:

* Local vulnerable PoC ‚Üí works.
* Mainnet ‚Üí patched with `onlyAdminExecutor`.
* The security lesson from this difference.

Do you want me to do that for you?
